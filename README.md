## 📙Problem Statement/Opportunity :
This application is developed to provide best services for the patients. I have SREEMEDS to provide a search platform where a patients can book their appointments according to their problem to which doctor or the specialist , he/she want to meet. We Build a website that have: Home Page, About Us page , Our Services page, Gallery page ,Contact Us page , Health bot.

## 📝Project Description :
Patients have lot of problems regarding appointments, and meds where patients have to wait in queues in hospitals to get an appointment and wait hours to get treated by a doctor.sreemeds will help us overcome all these problems because now patients can book their appointments at home. They can check whether the doctor they want to meet is available or not. Doctors can also confirm or decline appointments, this helps both the patients and the doctors. If the doctor declines the appointment then the patients will know this in advance and patient will visit hospital only when the doctor confirms’ the appointment this will save time and money of the patients.
